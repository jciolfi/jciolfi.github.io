This is a cloned and modified version of the particle theme from [nrandecker](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle.git). Improvements include reading from a standardized JSON format instead of hardcoding, opening up the potential to serve other users' sites as a remote Jekyll theme. I haven't received any interest for this yet, so I will keep the remote theme private for now.
